// EVERY real creation and the documented creation-handle contract never once
// held. The runtime parent belongs to the ordinary user, who can rename the new
// directory A away and drop an ordinary directory B at the predictable name in
// between, and the ledger then records B for a directory this run never made.
//
// Driving the interleaving is not the point, and a barrier there would only
// prove the window was still measurable. The property is that no reopen exists
// to be raced: whatever the name resolves to afterwards, the recorded identity
// is the object the create returned.
