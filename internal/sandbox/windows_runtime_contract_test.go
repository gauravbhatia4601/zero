// A LEASE FALLBACK MUST NOT BRICK THE WORKSPACE.
//
// Setup used to fingerprint a plan built from the cache-derived root, while a
// command derived the same root, failed to LEASE it, and silently relocated to
// the temp fallback. The command's plan then named a tree setup had never
// provisioned, and the marker rejected it with "permission roots or deny lists
// changed", which blames permissions for a runtime-root disagreement.
//
// Re-running setup could not recover: sandboxRuntimeRootFor rejects a candidate
// only for landing inside the workspace, never for being unusable, so setup
// chose the same unleasable root again. The only escapes were deleting the
// marker, which silently drops WFP network enforcement, or turning the sandbox
// off. Neither is mentioned by the error.
//
// Setup and the command select through one function now, so a fallback is
// something they agree on rather than something that splits them.
