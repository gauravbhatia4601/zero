//
// Deriving the reader from the runtime leaf's owner looked right and is wrong
// across the elevation boundary: the elevated helper CREATES that leaf when it
// is absent, so the owner is commonly BUILTIN\Administrators. A later
// UAC-filtered administrator carries that group deny-only, and a standard user
// given alternate administrator credentials is not in it at all, so the
// protected stamp ends up with no enabled allow ACE for the token that has to
// read it. Setup reports success and every restricted command then stops before
// launch.
//
// The consumer is therefore resolved in the operator's shell and carried in.
// This test pins that the carried identity wins over the leaf owner, which is
// the whole difference between the two designs.
